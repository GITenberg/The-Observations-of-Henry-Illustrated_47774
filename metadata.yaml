description: Meet Henry, who works as a waiter. Henry becomes acquainted with a variety
  of eccentric persons who visit the coffee shop he works in including a man whose
  baby is shown in a dog show and a customer who is eaten by a cannibal. Henry's gift
  for observation endears him as one of Jerome's most entertaining characters.
